I'm a Data Analyst with more than 2 years experience in National Security and the Financial Sector. I have always had a strong passion for Data Science. I am currently taking a course in Machine Learning at Blossom Academy. This course has equipped me with a lot of project insight and Machine Learning algorithms.
